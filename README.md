# tictactoeReact

-lets you play tic-tac-toe
-indicates when one play has won the game
-stores the history of moves during the game
-allows players to jump back to see older versions of the game board


# extra ideas for later
-display the move locations in the format(1,3) instead of 6
-bold the currently-selected item in the move list
-rewrite Board to use two loops to make squares instead of hardcoding them
-add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in ether ascending or descending order
-when someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
-notify of a draw
